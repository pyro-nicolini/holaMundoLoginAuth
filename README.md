In these exercises, we developed a Node.js API using Express and MongoDB. We learned how to set up a project, connect to a MongoDB database, and create a user model with Mongoose. We implemented various CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user management through a user controller, which handles API requests. We also organized our code into separate files for better maintainability. Finally, we discussed how to structure a README file to guide users on installing and running the API, along with best practices for preparing a repository for GitHub.
